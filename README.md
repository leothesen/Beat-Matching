# Beat Matching LED controller 

An Arduino project that listens to music via a microphone and recognizes the beat through a FFT. Connected LEDs are then made to display changing patters in time to the beat.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
